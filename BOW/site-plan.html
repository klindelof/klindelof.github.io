      <h3>FAQs</h3>
      <p>
        How do you put it on?
        Stick It! bowties have a strong magnet on the back. All you have to do is place one magnet where you want it to be, and then put the bowtie on the other side of the clothes.

        How do I take it off?
        The magnets won't budge when you pull on it (just in case you are dancing all night) but will easily come off if you slide it one way or the other. 

        Do you have matching options?
        Yes! We have enough bow ties for everyone in your family to get one! Or if you don't like to match and you out grew your favorite bow tie, we have a bigger option for you!

        Do you have different styles of bow ties?
        Of course! We have different styles and patterns, if you go to our styles page you will see a lot of them.
